# Healthcare_Recommender_System

This repository contains code for building a healthcare provider recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. The system analyzes user symptoms, user descriptions of symptoms using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and historical data of user-provider interactions to recommend suitable healthcare providers to users.

## Features
- **Analyzing Symptom Data:** Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze symptom data and identify potential health conditions or ailments. Supervised learning techniques such as classification are employed to predict health conditions based on input symptoms.
- **Interpreting User Descriptions of Symptoms using NLP:** NLP techniques are applied to understand and interpret user descriptions of symptoms provided in text format. Text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming are used to clean and normalize the text data.
- **Grouping Similar Symptoms or Conditions using Clustering Algorithms:** Unsupervised learning techniques like clustering are utilized to group similar symptoms or health conditions together based on their features.
- **Recommend Healthcare Providers using Collaborative or Content-Based Filtering:** Collaborative filtering techniques leverage historical user-provider interactions and ratings to recommend healthcare providers to users with similar preferences. Content-based filtering methods recommend healthcare providers based on their attributes and how well they match with the user's preferences. Hybrid approaches combine collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.
